# BIO2B: Genetics and Evolution - Mitosis and Meiosis
### Andrea Paterlini

Chromosomal segregation is important due to gene dosage:
* Copy number of a gene influences the corresponding amount of protein or RNA
* Expression from a defined and balanced gene number is important for cell function
* (missing notes)

Impact on cellular function:
* One less chromosome = 1/2 normal expression, one extra chromosome = 1.5 normal expression
* Insufficient amounts of a gene impairs critical reactions
* Too much protein is also problematic if they are part of complexes

One X chromosome in XX is completely deactivated.

Tortoiseshell cats do this, and the deactivation is completely random, so their patterns are completely random too.

That's only in mammals. Worms (e.g nematodes) dampen 50% and half of each chromosome contributes to the phenotype. Achieved via methylation.

Flies have a default lower expression that produces a complete phenotype when combined, and amp it up through acetylation in males. (X chromosome is buffed)

## Chromosomal mis-segregation
### Cancer
* Most tumours are **aneuploid**
* Structural chromosomal alterations are also frequent
* Higher mutation rate = stacking dosage changes
* Higher division rate = stacking changes
