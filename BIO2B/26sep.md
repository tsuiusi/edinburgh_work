# BIO2B: Genetics and Evolution - Epigenetics
### Andrea Paterlini

Epigenetics: the study of heritable changes in gene expression that cannot be explained by changes in the DNA sequence.

Heritable: inherited through mitosis and meiosis 

## DNA methylation
A methyl group is added to C nucleotides (often at CG DNA sequences) by *writer enzymes*, which are capable of making marks on the DNA. *Eraser proteins* can reverse the process.

Methylation in the gene promoter region inhibits binding of transcription factors.

Methylated DNA attacts *reader proteins* which can in turn promote/inhibit the recruitment of other proteins.

### Maintenance during DNA replication
Methylation has to be re-established on the new complementary strands of DNA.

At CG sites specific readers/writers can recognize hemi-methylated DNA and methylate the other strand.

This locks in the identity of the cell.

## Histone code
4 types of histones:
1. 2A
2. 2B
3. 3
4. 4

Other variants exist and can be exchanged with impacts on DNA accessibility.

Histones residues in tail regions can be acetylated, methylated, phosphorylated, and ubiquitylated by writer enzymes, and this new code is read and run by reader proteins.

### Histone modification examples
*H3K9ac*
* *H*istone *3* Lysine *K* residue at position *9* *ac*etylated
* DNA are negative (phosphate) whereas histones are positive (amino acids) -> attraction
* Acetylation by writers neutralizes positive charge (can also recruit readers)
* Looser DNA (less bound to histone), more accessible to transcription enzymes/machinery, more transcription

*H3K27me3*
* *H*istone *3* Lysine *K* residue at position *27*, tri-*3*-methylated
* Recruitment of readers and other factors that affect relative nucleosome positioning (delegating tasks to other proteins instead)
* Gene silencing
* Condenses the chromatin, prevents transcription, gene silenced

## Histone mark maintenance
During DNA replication, the nucleosomes are deboned and histones are taken out. 

Then, new histones are taken from the surroundings and they line up equally between the daughter strands with the parent histones.

The marks on the parental histones summon/recruit readers/writers to deposit marks on new histones.

## Notes
* Translation can also be affected
* Small and long non-coding RNAs implicated
* Different pathways interact with each other
* Epialleles: genomic regions where the epigenetic state naturally varies amongst individuals; so more malleable parts of DNA that favours change and adaptation

## Regulation of flowering time
A. thaliana is a winter plant, and flowering is repressed by the expression of the *flowering locus C* which encodes a negative transcription factor.

Vernalization: a process in plants where prolonged cold exposure induces a state that allows them to flower once it becomes warmer.

Histone modifications:
1. Acetylation
2. Methylation
3. Phosphorylation

Histone *acetylation* promotes transcription (opens chromatin), whereas histone *methylation* can promote or repress depending on the amino acid/histone modified.

Epigenetic conformation at many other loci in plant genomes isn't reset - epigenetic changes are retained across generations.

F1 means 1st generation *filial* offspring

The F2 generation having the same altered epigenetic marks proves trans-generational inheritance rather than the F1 generation as the F1 generation might've been directly exposed to the stressor, which would provide it the epigenetic change.

Could be stress acclimated or stress primed.

## Bees
The diet of a bee larva determines its position in bee society - worker jelly-> worker, royal jelly -> queens.

This is due to the phenolics in worker jelly - it contains pollen, plant material contains phenolics, larva doesn't grow as much (tannins are phenolics)

### Phenolics
DNA methylation affects the splicing of genes and recruitment of molecular components.

More methylation (workers) -> exons skipped, longer proteins produced
Less methylation (queen) -> exons are retained, shorter proteins produced
