# BIO2B: Genetics and Evolution 
### Week 5

Most complex traits are continuous in nature but not all continuous traits are complex.

Continuous: character/feature that exhibits a wide range of possible values along a continuum (e.g height, eye colour, etc)

QTL (Quantitative Trait Locus): DNA associated with a particular quantitative trait. Contain/linked to genes that contribute to the variations seen in a quantitative trait. Typically polygenic.

Additive effects = curse of agony + impending doom + battle rage

SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism): Genetic variation that occurs at a single nucleotide. 

APOE (Apoliprotein E): A gene that codes for protein involved in fat metabolism. e4 variant puts person at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's.

Linkage Disequilibrium: Frequency of association of alleles at 2 or more loci does not correspond to what would be expected if the loci were segregating independently during meiosis.

## Life Cycle of a Gene
### Horizontal gene transfer

Can occur through uptake from environment, transfer from bacteria, and injection by viruses.

Mitochondria and chloroplasts only have 1% and 2% of their original genome.

### Duplication
Autopolyploidisation: duplication by aneuploidy

### Hybridization
Sexual reproductionish but between different species to produce viable offspring. New genome emerges as a result.

### Whole chromosome duplication
Extra chromosomes.

### Replication error
Expansion and boom boom extra gene and everything in between.

### Unequal crossover
Lined up improperly, swapped weird

### Retrotransposition
Transcribed into RNA -> remade into DNA -> integrated into genome

A sequence needs an ORF (Open Reading Frame) and transcribed by RNA polymerase II to become a gene.

## What happens to genes
|Loss|Preservation|
|-|-|
|Deletion|Compensation|
|Genetic drift|Neofunctionalization|
|Selection against|Subfunctionalism|
|Loss of function via mutation (pseudogenization)|Lack of selection against|

Compensation: one copy is silent, regulated so levels of expression stay stable

Neofunctionalism: new function gained from a gene

Preservation: Temporal/specialization - different copies expressed in different cases

**Transposable elements (TEs)**:
* Class 1 - DNA -> RNA -> Integration
* Class 2 - DNA -> DNA excised -> Integration
