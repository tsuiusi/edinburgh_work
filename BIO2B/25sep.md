# Biology 2B: Genetics - Regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes
### Sveta Makovets

## Transcription
Monocistrionic: mRNA that encodes a single protein product
Polycistronic: mRNA that encodes multiple proteins; contains the genes for multiple products

Eukaryotes vs Prokaryotes:
1. Transcription and translation are uncoupled in eukaryotes
2. mRNA undergoes processing: 5'end capping, polydenylation, and splicing
3. Eukaryotic mRNAs are generally monocistronic

5'end Capping: the process of adding a modified G nucleotide of the pre-RNA molecule, which a) protects the mRNA from degradation b) involved in export of mature mRNA from the nucleus and c) helps initiate protein synthesis by binding to ribosomes.

Polydenylation: 

## Model organisms
Advantages of using model organisms:
1. Easy to breed and maintain in labs
2. Short generation times
3. Large number of offspring
4. Well studied genome

Advantages of using yeast:
1. Easy to grow and maintain
2. Short generation times, 1.5 hour per cycle
3. Large no. Offspring
4. Well studied genome
5. Efficient manipulation of genomes - knockout can be made in 3 days, exist in haploid and diploid forms
6. No ethical concerns
7. Decreased complexity (6.5k genes compared to 80-100k in humans)
8. Has all the fundamental processes of eukaryotic cells

Budding yeast types:
||a|alpha|Diploid|
|-|-|-|-|
|No. Chromosomes|16|16|32|
|Mating|√|√|X|

Not all haploids are the same - some genes are only expressed by alpha cells, some only expressed by a cells, and the genes expressed by both are known as *haploid specific cells*

Positive regulation needs an activator (a type of protein that binds to specific regions of DNA and increases the rate of transcription).
Activators often have two main functional domains:
1. DNA-binding domain: allows activator to bind to specific sequences of DNA
2. Activation domain: interacts with other proteins in the transcription machinery to facilitate binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter and the initiation of transcription.

Negative regulation involves repressor proteins, which bind to the DNA and prevent the transcription machinery (e.g RNA polymerase) from initiating transcription.
Key aspects:
1. Repressor proteins: they have a DNA-binding domain that allows them to bind to specific sequences in the promoter region or operator sites
2. Corepressors and inducers: helps repressor proteins function, binds to DNA and inhibits transcription only in the presence of a corepressor




## Yeast mating
1. Cells release pheromones (alpha factor)
2. G1 (mitosis) arrest, cells mate

### Pheromone signalling and response
Protein kinases: proteins that phosphorylate other proteins


# Homework
// something about repressing genes and promoting genes by preventing polymerase action with proteins binding to mcm1???
// positive and negative regulation of haploid specific genes
// how the pheromones in yeast mating works (see pictures)
// read all the gpt4 notes + g1 arrest 

g1 + g2 phase cell mating
triploid genes made, cannot undergo meiosis, so g1 arrest is important
