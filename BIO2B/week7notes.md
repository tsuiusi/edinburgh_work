# Types of Genetic Variation
* Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs)
* Insertion and Deletion (INDELs)
* Copy Number Variants (CNVs)
* Large Structural Variants (rearrangements)

All these can be referred to as a regional interest and hence a locus.

### SNPs
SNPS usually arise when there's a genetic advantage (e.g heterozygous for sickle cell)

### INDELs
INDELs arise during replication where slippage occurs in the nascent strand or the template strand. Nascent -> insertion, template -> deletion.

In Class 1 Insertion mutations, the replicated DNA (via reverse transcriptase) is inserted into the target DNA but in Class 2, the whole section is just transferred from the donor to target.

### CNVs
Like insertion, but described using the number of copies of a sequence.

In Huntington's, if there's <= 35 CAG repeats on chromosome 4 the human is healthy, but if there's more, Huntington's. 

### Large Strucutral Variants
Can be insertions and deletions on a larger scale. 

Can also be fission, fusion, and inversion (breaks and recombines with opposite chromosome). Can be adaptive or maladaptive.

## Methods of Describing Genetic Variation
### Measures of Diversity
Ï€ = no. nucleotide differences between pair-wise sequences / (no. sequence comparisons * no. sites)

Allele frequencies: (A Level)

Hardy Weinberg is used again to determine the expected genotypic frequencies.

Assumptions:
1. No migration
2. No mutations
3. Random mating
4. No gene flow
5. Infinite population size
6. No selection pressure
