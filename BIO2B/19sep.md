### Eukaryotic DNA
* Eukaryotic supercoiled DNA (coiling the coils) is stabilized by nucleosomes, which contain DNA wrapped around histones
* Chromatin consists of tightly packed, coiled nucleosomes
* The least condensed part of chromatin, euchromatin, is rich in genes whereas the most condensed regions, heterochromatin, contain non-coding DNA and very few genes
* Eukaryotic DNA is situated in the membrane bound nucleus

DNA -> Gene -> Chromosome -> Genome

### Introns
Most prokaryotic genes do not contain spliced introns
* Introns would inhibit translation  coupled to transcription in prokaryotes
* Introns appeared after eukaryotes diverged from prokaryotes

In eukaryotic DNA:
* Introns do not interfere with translation
* 

### Chromosomes
Chromosomes are organized in the nucleus during interphase in *chromosome territories*

They can be visualized via a method called FISH (Fluorescence in situ hybridization)

### How genomes are organized
Only 1% of the human genome encodes for protein
The number of genes identified is around 21000
>98% percent of the human genome is non-coding
