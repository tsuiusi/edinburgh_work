# BIO2B - Lactose
## Sveta Makovets

## Lactose intolerance
Lactose can be broken down to glucose and galactose by lactase.

Lactose intolerance is caused by the *gradually decreasing* expression of the LCT gene after infancy.

LCT gene expression is controlled by a regulatory element which is located in the MCM6 gene.

Individuals with inherited changes in this element lead to sustained lactose tolerance due to continued lactase production in the small intestine.

Lactase is useless after babies are weaned.

Lactase is produced in fungi (yeast and mold) and can be used to break down lactose in milk.

## Lac Operon
β-galactosidase = Lactase

The Lac operon is a set of genes in bacteria used to regulate the metabolism of lactose. 

There are 3 genes:
1. LacZ: Encodes β-galactosidase
2. LacY: Encodes lactose permease, a channel protein for lactose
3. LacA: Encodes thiogalactoside transacetylase, an enzyme that can modify certain sugars

Lactase production can be accelerated if you add mutate CAP so it doesn't need cAMP to bind to it for it to bind to the activator binding site (decoupling) and deleting the lacl gene.

The lacl gene is the lac repressor - it can bind to a specific part of the DNA of the lac operon called the operator, and prevents transcription from occuring in that stage.

However, the presence of lactose releases the lac operator from the operator, and lactase will be produced again.

## Plasmids
Function of plasmids:
1. Fertility: mating between bacteria
2. Horizontal gene transfer
3. Degradation of rare substances
4. Virulence: contains the genes allowing bacteria to become virulent

Conjugation (gene transfer):
Plasmids are replicated and transferred into another bacterial cell via pili.

Partial diploids:
Plasmids can be integrated into the chromosome and excised back, and during the excision some of the chromosome may be excised out with the plasmid.
