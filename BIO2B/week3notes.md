## DNA Damage and Repair
### DNA damage and its sources
Types of DNA lesions:
1. Single strand break - phosphodiester bond breaks on one part of the sugar-phosphate backbone
2. Double strand break - same deal, another strand
3. Bulky adduct - covalent bonding of carcinogenic aromatic compounds to DNA
4. Interstrand crosslink - nucleotides hydrogen bonding across different parts of the strand (like the 3rd and 5th rungs of a ladder being connected instead of 33 and 55)
5. Base mismatch - A&G, C&T
Base alkylation - alkylation of a base

Sources of damage:
1. UV light- thymine dimers break
2. Ionising radiation - ss and dsDNA breaks
3. Alcohol - interstrand crosslinks
4. Oxidative damage - oxidised bases from oxygen leaking past the bilayer of the mitochondria
5. Mechanical stress - dsDNA breaks

The largest source of a lesion is DNA replication: 
1. DNA is unpacked so it's more exposed to the elements
2. Mistakes may be uncorrected by DNA polymerase
3. Unpaired bases are exposed to reactive molecules

DNA lesions don't equate to mutations as they can be repaired and returned into original DNA.

Mutation - genetic change in DNA

Mutant - an organism carrying a mutation

### Repair of DNA lesions
Cut and patch: A small section of DNA (1-100 nucleotides) is cut out to remove structural damage, then filled back in via DNA polymerase.

Photolyase: light-activated enzyme that cleaves the thymine dimer bond

DSBs (Double strand breaks) and ICLs (Interstrand crosslinks):

Caused by:
|DSBs|ICLs|
|-|-|
|Broken replication forks|Endogenous metabolites (acetaldehyde/intermediate from alcohol metabolism)|
|Unseparated sister chromatids in mitosis|Specific chemicals (chemo)|
|Ionising radiation||
|Chemo drugs||

### DSB Repair (2 Pathways):
**Ligation of broken ends** - Error prone, causes small insertions and deletions near the site of repair
**Homologous recombination** - Requires homologous chromosome as template, and section will be copied from the unbroken DNA

**Erroneous repair**:
1. Telomere added to break - the other end will be lost, causing a terminal deletion in the chromosome as it doesn't have a centromere to segregate this properly
2. Reciprocal translocation - 2 pieces of chromosomes break at same time, but segments are swapped instead
3. Break ligated into wrong chromosome - either forms a dicentric chromosome (very unstable) or arm is ligated onto another chromosome

Gross chromosomal rearrangements: 
1. Large deletions
2. Large inversions
3. Large insertions
4. Translocations

All can arise from erroneous DSB repair, and are common in cancer cells.

### ICL Repair and cancer connections
* Not dangerous to cells unless they're replicating
* Replication cannot be done if the two strands can't be unzipped
