# BIO2B Genetics and Evolution

## Evolutionary conflict and cooperation
Balance between investment in offspring and no. offspring.

In males, the no. offspring increases ~linearly with the number of mates but no. offspring levels off for females.

This is due to the increased investment by females (more nutrients needed).

Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor)

Igf2 is active in males but not in females, and the receptor is active in females (which inhibits the Igf2).

When this balance is balanced, the offspring will be normal sized but if it isn't you get big rat babies.

A beetle is designed to damage the reproductive tract of a female so his offspring has a greater chance of survival - the female isn't technically harmed.

> Evolutionary sexual conflict depends on if the traits are on the same or different loci

### Different loci (like the beetle)

In the case of the beetle, the females evolve resistance (kicking) which forces selection on the males to push harder -> arms race or chase away sexual selection.

(now onto drosophila)

Selective advantages:
* More sperm and more eggs
* Better eggs
* Decrease attractiveness of mate
* Decrease receptivity of mate

This is called mate manipulation.

Differences can be:
* Anatomical
* Physiological
* Behavioural
* Proteins made

### Same locus
Showiness and colour

'Good' genes for male guppies and female guppies are different, and will be pretty annoying if swapped -> sex linked.

## Altruistic behaviour
* Grooming in apes
* Alarm calls in birds


### Group selection
Selection of group > individual

Mutation can cause this to fall apart -> not **Evolutionary Stable Strategy**

ESS: when adopted by all the population, cannot be invaded by any alternative strategy

### Kin selection
r - Wright's coefficient of relatedness

|Relationship|r|
|-|-|
|Yourself|1.0|
|Full Siblings|0.5|
|Parents/Offspring|0.5|
|Half Siblings|0.25|
|Aunt/Uncle/Niece/Nephew|0.25|
|Grandparent/Grandchild|0.25|
|First Cousins|0.125|

Inclusive fitness
w_i = a_i - c_i + âˆ‘r_ij b_ij

w_i = inclusive fitness of donor

a_i = direct fitness of donor

c_i = effect of altruistic act on donor's own direct fitness

r_ij = coefficient of relatedness

b_ij = increase in fitness by recipient from action of donor


Basically calculates how much of genes are passed on even if you don't bang.

Altruism will evolve if:
> relatedness * benefit to recipient > cost to donor


## Life History
The framework that examines the distribution of major events over the lifetime of an individual.

Always negative relationship between time and survival.

### Senescence
Deleterious mutations:

|D1| Young|
|D2| Old|
|D3| Young and old|

D3 will be strongly selected against, then 2, then 1

Antagonistic pleiotropy: deleterious mutations that affect older individuals stack in populations

(Pleiotropy is when a single gene influences multiple seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits)

|Mutation accumulation theory|No effect on young, only old|
|Antagonistic pleiotropy|Positive effect on young, negative on old|

Tradeoff.

Tradeoffs are the central tenet of life history theory.
* All activities require energy
* Resources are limited
* Resources allocated to one trait cannot be allocated in another

### Reproduction

Semelparous: reproduce once then die (salmon,mayflies)

Iteroparous: reproduces multiple times over lifetime (most animals)

Tradeoffs determining whether an organism is s or i:
* Juvenile survival v adult survival
* Consistency of juvenile environment

Better to have better risk management in unpredictable environments and be iteroparous.
