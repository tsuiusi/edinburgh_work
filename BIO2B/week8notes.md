# BIO2B Genetics and Evolution

## Evolutionary conflict and cooperation
Balance between investment in offspring and no. offspring.

In males, the no. offspring increases ~linearly with the number of mates but no. offspring levels off for females.

This is due to the increased investment by females (more nutrients needed).

Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor)

Igf2 is active in males but not in females, and the receptor is active in females (which inhibits the Igf2).

When this balance is balanced, the offspring will be normal sized but if it isn't you get big rat babies.

A beetle is designed to damage the reproductive tract of a female so his offspring has a greater chance of survival - the female isn't technically harmed.

> Evolutionary sexual conflict depends on if the traits are on the same or different loci

### Different loci (like the beetle)

In the case of the beetle, the females evolve resistance (kicking) which forces selection on the males to push harder -> arms race or chase away sexual selection.

(now onto drosophila)

Selective advantages:
* More sperm and more eggs
* Better eggs
* Decrease attractiveness of mate
* Decrease receptivity of mate

This is called mate manipulation.

Differences can be:
* Anatomical
* Physiological
* Behavioural
* Proteins made

### Same locus
Showiness and colour

'Good' genes for male guppies and female guppies are different, and will be pretty annoying if swapped -> sex linked.

## Altruistic behaviour
* Grooming in apes
* Alarm calls in birds


### Group selection
Selection of group > individual

Mutation can cause this to fall apart -> not **Evolutionary Stable Strategy**

ESS: when adopted by all the population, cannot be invaded by any alternative strategy

### Kin selection
r - Wright's coefficient of relatedness

|Relationship|r|
|-|-|
|Yourself|1.0|
|Full Siblings|0.5|
|Parents/Offspring|0.5|
|Half Siblings|0.25|
|Aunt/Uncle/Niece/Nephew|0.25|
|Grandparent/Grandchild|0.25|
|First Cousins|0.125|

Inclusive fitness
w_i = a_i - c_i + âˆ‘r_ij b_ij

w_i = inclusive fitness of donor

a_i = direct fitness of donor

c_i = effect of altruistic act on donor's own direct fitness

r_ij = coefficient of relatedness

b_ij = increase in fitness by recipient from action of donor


Basically calculates how much of genes are passed on even if you don't bang.

Altruism will evolve if:
> relatedness * benefit to recipient > cost to donor
