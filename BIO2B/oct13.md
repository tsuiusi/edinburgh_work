# BIO2B: Genetics and Evolution
### Andrea Paterlini

* Single alleles rarely determine the phenotype by itself - genetic pathways
* Allelic interactions can occur in heterozygotes (dominance) and homozygotes (lethal alleles)
* Gene dosage can explain recessive/dominant mutations (haplosufficiency/insufficiency), and dominant/negative situations can explain other dominant mutations
* Non-allelic interactions can be recessive/dominant in diploids:
    * Epistatic cases (masking)(one gene inhibits another)
    * Duplicate and complementary gene action
    * Modifiers (alters expression)
    * Suppressors (reverts to wild type)

## Dominance
* Complete dominance
* Incomplete dominance
* Codominance

## Antigens and genes
