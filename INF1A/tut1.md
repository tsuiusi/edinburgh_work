# INF1A Tutorial 1

## Exercise 1
Boolean identifiers:
1. Do you support abortion?
2. Do you support the death sentence?
3. You are sentenced to lifetime imprisonment for an arbitrary crime, but you will be excused and set free if you kill an infant with your bare hands. Do you do it?
4. Do you believe the governing body should be selected by meritocracy?
5. Do you think the world should be governed by a single body or by multiple nations, as we have now?
6. Are people having too many babies?
7. Is it true that the nature of an action is determined by the nature of the actor and not by the nature of the action? (would the same sentence convey a different meaning if said by two different people?)
8. Do you think you can learn everything taught by your course by yourself? (As in self-teach everything)
9. Are STEM subjects inherently better than the humanities? (this may be skewed due to the sample group)
