# Introduction to Linear Algebra - Linear Transformations

A function T: Rn -> Rm is called a **Linear Transformation** if it satisfies the two condition for all vectors x, y E R and all scalars a:
1. T(x+y) = T(x) + T(y)
2. T(ax) = aT(x)

**VERY IMPORTANT IDEA**

For each m x n matrix A, let TA: Rn -> Rm be the transformation defined by:
TA(x) = Tx(A) = Ax

A transformation is only linear iff it's a matrix transformation

So every linear transformation is a matrix transformation induced by some matrix A

Check for linear transformations. Some operations only work for linear transformations.
