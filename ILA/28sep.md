# Introduction to Linear Algebra
### Andreas Grothey

Ax=0, xâ‰ 0, then A=0?
False
(1 -1) (1 1)


The dot product can be used to compute the product of a matrix and a vector
Theorem 2.2.5 - each entry of the vector Ax is the dot product of the corresponding row of A with x

Distributive = A(x + y) = Ax + Ay
Associative = A(ax) = a(Ax)
