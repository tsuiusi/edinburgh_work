An equation of the form:
$$ a1x1 + a2x2 + anxn = b $$
is called a *linear equation* in the n variables x1, x2, ...xn.

a1, a2, ...an denote real numbers (coefficients) and b is also a number (constant term)

A finite collection of linear equations in the variables x1, x2, ...xn is called a system of linear equations in these variables.

$$ 2x1 - 3x2 + 5x3 = 7 $$ is a linear equation.

Given a linear equation 
$$ a1x1 + a2x2 + ...anxn = b $$
 a sequence of s1, s2 ...sn of n numbers is called a solution to the equation of
$$ a1s1 + a2s2 + ...ansn = b $$

A system that has no solution is *inconsistent*, whereas a system with at least one solution is *consistent*.

If a system has one equation, then there must be infinitely many solutions.
If a system has two equations, there are 3 scenarios possible:
1. Intersect on one point - one solution
2. Parallel lines - no solution
3. Identical lines - infinitely many solutions
